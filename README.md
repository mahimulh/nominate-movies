# Movie Nominations
## Shopify's UXDeveloper Intern & Web Developer Intern Challenge - Summer 2021

What is includes:
- Search OMDB and display the results (movies only)
- Add a movie from the search results to our nomination list
- View the list of films already nominated
- Remove a nominee from the nomination list
- Save nomination lists if the user leaves the page
- Animations for loading, adding/deleting movies, notifications

NOTE: The deployed build for an unknown reason does not show the overlays. They appear in the local verion (npm start) but not after building (npm run build). I was not able to figure it out in time. This is what it looks like when it's fully visible:https://imgur.com/WvN6nFg

INSTRUCTIONS: To nominate, click near the bottom of the movie image. To remove, also click near the bottom.
